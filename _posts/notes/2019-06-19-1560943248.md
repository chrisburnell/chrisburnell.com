I think I'm going to try to make this happen. For a long time I have been building my site on a mostly vanilla Jekyll set-up as an example of a complex site that works on GitHub Pages, but I can't honestly say I've ever had someone find that a useful resource, at least not that I'm aware of. I still think GitHub Pages is a great way for people to get a website quickly, but there are so many other options to do just that today, compared to five years ago, that I don't think it's to _anyone's_ benefit that I continue living and building in this <q>old-school</q> way.
