0. Combine all ingredients in a bowl.
0. Pour into a medium-heat pan in batches to create thin layers. Just as each layer cooks, roll it up and push to one side of the pan, then start the next layer, building up the layers upon previous layers until done. Use a spatula to shape the tamago, as best as possible, into a rectangular shape.
