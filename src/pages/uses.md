## Coding

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for coding with [Wes Bos’](https://wesbos.com) [Cobalt2 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2); although, I’m currently trying to familiarise myself with [Vim](https://www.vim.org), so these days I often simply use that or a plugin within *Visual Studio Code*.

My terminal of choice is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) running [Z shell/zsh](https://www.zsh.org). [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) allows me to easily manage my *zsh* configuration and pulls in [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k) for theming.

My font of choice for coding is [Menlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)), and for my terminal I use a variation, [Menlo for Powerline](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline), which allows me to use non-standard characters for constructing my *zsh*/*Oh My Zsh*/*Powerlevel9k* theme.

## Hardware

I run a *Mid-2015 15" Retina Macbook Pro* with a 4-core i7 processor and 16 GB of RAM.

When I’m able to, I also use a [Ducky One RGB TKL keyboard](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One-RGB-TKL) and a [Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum mouse](https://www.logitechg.com/en-hk/products/gaming-mice/g502-proteus-spectrum-rgb-gaming-mouse.html). *All the colours.*
