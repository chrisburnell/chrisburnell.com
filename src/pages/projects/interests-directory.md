This project was born after I [proposed the idea](/note/slash-interests/) for website authors to create <code style="white-space: nowrap;">/interests</code> pages on their websites, a place to list out and talk about things they’re passionate about!

<nav class=" [ grid ] [ navigator ] ">
    <a href="https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/" class="[ button ] " rel="external noopener">The /interests Directory →</a>
</nav>
