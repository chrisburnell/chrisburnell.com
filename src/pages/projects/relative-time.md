## Features

<code>&lt;relative-time&gt;</code> is a native Web Component that displays a relative time based on a nested `<time>` element.

## Usage

You start using the <code>&lt;relative-time&gt;</code> Web Component by including a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="relative-time.js"></script>
```

### General usage example

All `<relative-time>` elements must have a `<time>` element inside with a `datetime` attribute.

```html
<relative-time><time datetime="2024-04-09T00:00:00+14:00">9 April 2024</time></relative-time>
```

### Update frequency

By default, `<relative-time>` elements will update their time every 10 minutes or whenever the window/tab loses and gains focus. You can override this by providing an `update` attribute, which represents the number of seconds between each update.

```html
<relative-time update="1"><time datetime="2024-04-09T00:00:00+14:00">9 April 2024</time></relative-time>
```

You can also disable these updates by setting the `update` attribute to `false`.

```html
<relative-time update="false"><time datetime="2024-04-09T00:00:00+14:00">9 April 2024</time></relative-time>
```

### Specific division

By default, the time shown in the countdown will cycle through seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years to show an appropriate representation of the remaining/elapsed time.

You can override this by providing a `division` attribute to force the time shown to be formatted in the given units of time.

```html
<relative-time division="second"><time datetime="2024-04-09T00:00:00+14:00">9 April 2024</time></relative-time>
```

### Maximum division

You can also override the maximum unit of time used by providing a `max-division` attribute. The countdown will only go as high as provided unit of time when displaying the countdown.

```html
<relative-time max-division="minute"><time datetime="2024-04-09T00:00:00+14:00">9 April 2024</time></relative-time>
```
