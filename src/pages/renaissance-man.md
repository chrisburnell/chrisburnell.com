## Renaissance Man

I had a wonderfully-fortunate upbringing, and I attribute a great deal of who I am today to my parents and their parents.

My maternal grandfather, or *Opa* as his grandchildren called him, was a highly-analytical, incredibly smart, and successful man. I attribute my love for logic and reasoning to the influence of this enigmatic figure in my life. It was, unfortunately, after his passing that the weight of his contributions to science, chemistry and physics in particular, were realised to me. He helped usher in an evolution in the way scientists were able to observe and understand small molecules by way of building Canada's first <abbr title="Nuclear Magnetic Resonance">NMR</abbr> instrument, for which he was recognised in Professor Richard Ernst’s acceptance speech of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
