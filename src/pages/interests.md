## Tech Stuff

### CSS

This one probably comes as absolutely no surprise, and it might just be one of my favourite things of anything listed on this page. I’ve been espousing my love for CSS for well over a decade now—to the point that I became <q>the CSS guy</q> at work—this energy just don’t stop!

You can check out all my [CSS-tagged posts](/tag/css/), and if you share my love for this beautiful language, why not flick through the [CSSJoy Webring](https://webri.ng/webring/cssjoy/) to find dozens of other fantastic websites of folks who <q>enjoy experimenting with CSS</q>!

### Content Ownership

In building website, I’ve always espoused the importance of meeting people where they’re at, i.e. let’s not overcomplicate things and drive people away from participating at all. And ever since discovering the [IndieWeb] back in January 2018, content ownership on the web has only become all the more important to me.

There’s been quite a bit of discussion recently about how to better <q>onboard</q> people to the IndieWeb recently, and I think this is a good thing. The barrier to entry is pretty high at the moment, but it’s great to

## Fantasy (genre)

### Lord of the Rings

Huge fan of Tolkein and all his works. Deep world building is just totally my jam. I’ve read the books many times and the movies about once a month.

The Hobbit movies were pretty disappointing, though, and Rings of Power is downright *bad*.

### Dungeons &amp; Dragons

Although I don’t get to play much these days, I’m an avid Dungeon Master (and sometimes player) of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (5<sup>th</sup> edition).

I’ve been tinkering away on my own sprawling campaign for a number of years now, and have written a handful of one-shots along the way.

### Dragonlance

What an amazing series. I haven’t given myself the opportunity to finish the main series (as of January 2024), but I really ought to carve out the time to get back into reading. And this is the series that’ll do it, I’m sure.

## Food &amp; Drink

- Yangzhou fried rice
- Beer
- Root beer

### Coffee

I love coffee, and I drink a lot of it. You can check out my coffee setup over on my [/uses](/uses/#coffee) page.
