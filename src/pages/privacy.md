## Activity and Interaction

I use a handful of services, most often in the form of Webmentions, to keep track of how people interact with the content I make. If you have responded to, liked, reposted, quoted, commented on my activity on Mastodon, Twitter, or this website, it may be stored and displayed on this website. If you would like your interaction(s) removed, blocked, or even corrected, please [get in touch](/about/#contact), and I would be happy to oblige your request.

## Tracking

I’m currently trialling [Fathom Lite](https://usefathom.com/) (self-hosted) as a means of keeping track of popular pages, mostly to make sure pages that people visit often are functioning as-intended. Here’s what Fathom has to say about the [data that they track](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#what-data-does-fathom-track):

> Fathom tracks no personally identifiable information on your visitors.
>
> When Fathom tracks a pageview, your visitor is assigned a random string which is used to determine whether it's a unique pageview. If your visitor visits another page on your site, the previous pageview is processed & deleted within 1 minute. If the visitor leaves your site, the pageview is processed & deleted when the session ends (in 30 minutes).
>
> If <q>Do Not Track</q> is enabled in the browser settings, Fathom respects that.

## Offline Support

I make use of Service Workers, so if you’re using a relatively modern browser, you’ll be able to enjoy the benefits of this technology. In short, it’s a form of client-side caching. This means that your device will cache certain parts of this website in order to provide you a faster experience, and even enable you to take this website offline! I do not (and cannot) collect any information about you or your browsing experience from Service Workers.

## Further

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding your privacy on this website, please [contact me](/about/#contact) so that I can address it as soon as possible.
