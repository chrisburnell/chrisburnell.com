## Tracking

I’m currently using [Fathom Lite](https://usefathom.com/) [(self-hosted)](https://logs.chrisburnell.com) as a means of keeping track of popular pages and referrals, mostly to make sure that frequently-visited pages are functioning as intended and to see where my referral traffic is coming from. It presents the following metrics: page views, unique visitors, average time spent on the website, bounce rate, and referrals.

*Fathom Lite* sets a (first-party) cookie in your browser in order to keep track of page visits and distinguish unique visitors. I welcome you to disable cookies and/or requests to `logs.chrisburnell.com` if you do not want to be tracked in this way.

You can read more about what Fathom has to say about the [data that they track](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#what-data-does-fathom-track).

## Activity and Backfeed

I pull Webmentions (hosted on [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io)) into relevant pages, but only Webmentions sent deliberately in reply to one of my pages are displayed. Likes, reposts, bookmarks, replies made on social media, etc. (i.e. backfeed from [Bridgy](https://brid.gy)) are anonymised and are only shown as part of a count in the responses section of relevant pages.

If you have responded to, liked, reposted, quoted, or commented on my activity on Mastodon, Twitter, or this website, it may be stored and displayed on this website. If you would like your interaction(s) removed, blocked, or even corrected, please [get in touch](/about/#contact), and I would be happy to oblige your request as quickly as possible.

## Third-party calls

I have made every attempt to limit calls to third-party resources. Where possible, I am using self-hosted endpoints to prevent calls from your browser to third parties.

This is *not* possible for certain resources hosted by third parties, like YouTube video embeds.

--------

## Offline Support

My website will install a Service Worker in supported browsers to make my website function when an internet connection is not available. In essence, it’s a form of client-side caching. This means that core assets will be cached by your browser to speed up subsequent usage of those files, in addition to caching the core top-level pages and any pages you’ve visited while online, making them available when you are offline!

I do not (and cannot) collect any information about you or your browsing experience from Service Workers.

## Further

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding your privacy on this website, please [contact me](/about/#contact) so that I can address it as soon as possible.
