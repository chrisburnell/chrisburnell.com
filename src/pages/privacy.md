## Activity and Interaction

I use a handful of services, most often in the form of Webmentions, to keep track of how people interact with the content I make. If you have responded to, liked, reposted, quoted, commented on my activity on Mastodon, Twitter, or this website, it may be stored and displayed on this website. If you would like your interaction(s) removed, blocked, or even corrected, please [get in touch](/about/#contact), and I would be happy to oblige your request.

## Browse Freely

I no longer serve **any** analytics or tracking of any kind. This is because I value privacy on the web, to smoothen the performance out and take fuller control of this website, and to promote [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) technologies.

I make use of Service Workers, so if you’re using a relatively modern browser, you’ll be able to enjoy the benefits of this technology. In short, it’s a form of client-side caching. This means that your device will cache certain parts of this website in order to provide you a faster experience, and even enable you to take this website offline! I do not (and cannot) collect any information about you or your browsing experience from Service Workers.

## Ads

I serve ads on this website through [Carbon Ads](https://www.carbonads.net/). If you experience an ad that you think is inappropriate or offends you, please [contact me](/about/#contact) so that I can take it to the necessary channels and get it removed.

## Further

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding your privacy on this website, please [contact me](/about/#contact) so that I can address it as soon as possible.
