I re-read *The Hobbit* and *Lord of the Rings* just about every year and watch the movies even more often than that, so I figured it was time to get back into tracking books that I’m reading. And what better way to do that than with one of my favourite books of all time.

This time, though, I’m listening to the audiobook version narrated by Andy Serkis who has done an exceptional job of it!
