I re-read *The Hobbit* and *Lord of the Rings* pretty much annually, and figured it was time to get back into tracking books that I’m reading. And what better way to do that than with one of my favourite books of all time.

This time time, however, I’m listening to the audiobook version narrated by Andy Serkis who does an exceptionally great job of it!
