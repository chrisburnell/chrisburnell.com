I remember this album playing in my Dad’s car often when I was young, and never had any particular draw towards it, but I have fond memories of nodding in and out of sleep while this played from a cassette tape in his rusty old Mazda I had named <q>Chickalude</q>. My Mum’s car was called <q>Kaku</q>; although, I called everything <q>Kaku</q> when I named the car in my early years. Revisiting this album decades later, I love this album for its nostalgia, but also its melodic, jazzy, synth-driven sound.
