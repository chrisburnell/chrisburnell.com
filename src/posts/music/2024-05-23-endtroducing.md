I cannot believe that I hadn’t graced my website with this prodigious album until now. Words fail to capture how massive and game-changing this album was. It’s composed *almost* entirely of samples, which is a feat in and of itself.

DJ Shadow displays a complete mastery of the [Akai MPC60 sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akai_MPC) with his meticulous layering of funk, jazz, rock, and soul elements to create a rich atmosphere of loops and beats.

Although it took some time for his sound to gain worldwide traction, there’s absolutely no question that *Endtroducing.....* is a certified classic, engraving DJ Shadow’s name in the stonework of hip-hop and sampling as one of the best to ever do it.
