This album means a lot to me. This album came into my life just before the summer after Grade 10, and I remember listening to this almost-religiously with my close friends. It pulled us together and over that summer and during the next couple of years, we ended up forming a four-piece rock band, and played a handful of coffeehouses—once in the cafeteria of a residence hall at University—but the best part were the jam sessions. The funky and soulful sound that *RHCP* perform on this album was refined, polished and unbelievably-catchy. And it still is.
