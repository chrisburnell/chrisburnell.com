Ever since my first taste of web development, I eagerly threw myself down the rabbit hole. Here was something I loved doing so much that I forsake sleep and rest and a very many other things to pursue this new-found passion. It was not uncommon for me to stay up late and into the early morning hours tinkering on one thing or another.

I remember during my first few months of building my very first website thinking to myself, <q>if it’s supposed to take 10,000 hours of deliberate and purposeful practice to achieve mastery of a craft, I’m on my way there now</q>. After 18 years, give or take, spent dedicating so much of my time and effort to this craft, I’d like to think I’ve achieved something. *Certainly not mastery*, but something worth acknowledging, at least. And at least half that time has been spent under the cover of night.

There’s something about the quiet and the dark of the midnight hours that helps me find my best ideas and work. I think it’s the solitude, the peacefulness, this sense that the day’s obligations have come and gone, and now *this* time is for *me*. Whether it’s a quirk about who I am or a reflection of building the habit from my teenage years into my twenties, nighttime is when I feel the most comfortable and energised.

When COVID struck and I had to work from home—a fact that I don’t totally resent—I went on a *lot* of walks. At the time, I lived in East London, close to the beautiful Walthamstow Marshes, where I would take a walk just about every day, if not more often than that.

Having this time away to enjoy nature, when it *wasn’t* the time to be developing or writing or drawing, when it *was* the time to hold my partner’s hand and talk about whatever, enjoy the weather, look out for local birds, and think about how old the great trees must be or how cosmically breathtaking all this is, this world we live in… The value of this time and routine of looking forward to the mental time-off cannot be overstated.

As someone who’s spent my fair share of time living away from my family and loved ones, I can say with serious conviction that distance *does* make the heart grow fonder. Just like the first hug from someone who I haven’t seen in far too long, having to step away from my creative endeavours fills me with a real sense of renewal and vigour when the time comes to return to it.

<hr style="--rule-space: var(--size-medium);">

Having lived in London for 12 years, I consider myself immensely lucky to have had the opportunity to attend many [meet-ups and conferences](/rsvps/). In 2018, I was even more lucky to have been invited to join the team of organisers for [London Web Standards](https://londonwebstandards.org/) and [State of the Browser](https://stateofthebrowser.com/). Challenging and stressful work to be sure, but immensely rewarding.

Although I tend to be a quiet and shy person—I am unquestionably an introvert—attending conferences have helped me get out of my shell and feel connected to my peers like nothing else. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting so many incredible people and, heartwarmingly, have witnessed myself fill the distinguished role of being considered their friends.

There’s something too to be said about the wealth of bright and engaging thinkers, bloggers, designers, developers, etc. in the communities I’m proud to be part of. It would feel like counting stars if I were to tally the people I’ve come to know and whose work I now follow, and the value of their words is beyond measure.

I’ve also had the good fortune to behold scores of life-changing talks. If activity on my website is any evidence, there is very little so motivating and inspiring as being in this space. For every spark of creativity found in the depths of night, plucking away on the keyboard on my own, there are a hundred more that erupt like a lightning storm from being around such amazing people and captivating conferences and meet-ups.

<hr style="--rule-space: var(--size-medium);">

If it can be boiled down at all, my well of creativity springs from a measured temperence. Solitude, space to focus, time away to unfocus, and the everflowing inspiration and motivation that comes from time with friends and diving into the rabbit holes of someone else’s mind all stand shoulder-to-shoulder in this ideal balance.
