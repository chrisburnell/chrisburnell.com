title: Behemoth
description: Ever since hearing of Zach Leatherman’s static site generator, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, in 2018, I was entranced, and as much as I still do love Jekyll, my bloated use of it suddenly looked tarnished and worn.

So the seed was planted, and the rabbit hole deep-dive began, but it seemed like such an undertaking. A major part of the ethos behind my website as it was then had to do with getting more people to create their *own* website, to *own their content*, and lowering the barriers to doing that. It all had to do with a fascination-turned-passion for the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), a movement dedicated to providing alternatives to the siloed web of today, putting control in the hands of users, rather than the companies operating behemoth social networks.

But I digress—oh, speaking of behemoth—so during the inception of the Jekyll build, one simple avenue for developers to get their own website or blog was to use GitHub Pages, which, *conveniently*, is powered by Jekyll! But it comes with a small but understandable catch: you can't use any Jekyll plugins (except a small but truly incredibly useful handful). I was determined to make my build plugin-free, so I did.

It was a rewarding but painstaking process that evolved over **seven years**, likely because I set high standards for my website, and I kept finding weeds in the garden; there were many intricate parts of the build that were so customised to how I liked to author my posts and how my website was structured, calculated, and built. I did make every endeavour to abstract away the specifics of my needs from whatever little *include* or *snippet* I used, but ultimately it lead to a sluggish build that was difficult to maintain, on top of honestly being an eyesore.

After many failed starts (I swear I must have made half a dozen "cb11ty" folders) and [totally relevant diversions](https://chrisburnell.com/projects/), I began the process of rewriting everything from scratch, and after about two weeks, it was at last complete. I was pretty careful that I wasn’t just moving old weeds into the new garden, but I’m sure some slipped through the cracks.

What makes me positive this was a good move for me is the mentality it’s given me towards maintaining this garden. So often, before, I’d pore through the code powering the website while waiting 2½ minutes for the build to complete because I misspelled a word in a Markdown file. I’d find myself fixing things all over the place, with no real direction to things. I’d revisit code over and over again, flip-flopping between solutions because I needed it to be perfect.

Hypocrite.

One of the other main parts of the ethos behind my website then—and now—is that in front end development, there’s no one way to do any given thing. Sure, there might be *the most performative way*, but am I really so interested in web development to spend that much time crunching numbers and mix-maxing on *my own website*? Even more so, does the person reading my website notice a difference between a solution that’s 99% of the way there versus the perfect one? *Maybe?* If they’re used to browsing perfect websites, definitely!

*I don’t think so.*
