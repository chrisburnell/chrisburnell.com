title: "Share and Back Again"
lede: "On a website on the Internet there lived a webpage. Not a table-laden soup of divs, filled with JavaScript and a dozen half-used frameworks, nor yet a portion of the page that could be read by a human that a robot could not: it was written for all, and that means microformats."

Thick metaphors aside, I’m talking about writing code that speaks

This post aims to unravel some of the mystery which surrounds *microdata*, *microformats*, <abbr title="Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr>, <abbr title="Resource Description Framework in Attributes">RDFa</abbr>, and the like.


<h2 id="whats-the-point">What's the point?</h2>

The whole point of marking up your content with one of the various formats is to make your content <dfn title="capable of being understood">grokkable</dfn> by computers. By using one of these systems, you can, with relative ease (depending on the solution you choose), make a great portion of your content available for computers to parse and, in a way, understand.

In the same way that Facebook collects stasuses from your friends' feeds and displays them on the homepage in a unified feed, these data-exposing frameworks can enable you to parse a webpage and break it down into bits that fit into a common vocabulary.
