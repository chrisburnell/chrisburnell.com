title: Daily Word Games
description: For at least a year now, I’ve been having daily video calls with my parents for a quick catch-up and to play some online word games. It’s a real highlight to my day (especially considering I’m on the opposite side of the world from them), so in this post I’ll run through some of those games that we play.

## Jumblie

We typically start with [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com) by [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co), a game where you are given a theme and a smattering of letters, and you have to find four 4–9 letter words composed of those letters.

Once you’ve found a word, the corresponding letters are removed from the list and the word is shown below with a background colour (red, orange, green, blue). Red indicates it is the shortest word in the group, and blue indicates the longest. Orange is the 2<sup>nd</sup>-shortest word, and green the 2<sup>nd</sup> longest, but sometimes words will be the same length.

It’s a lot of fun! Our best time is 7 seconds; although, we usually come in somewhere around the 1-minute mark, and have had games so badly as to take more than 10 minutes. Those are a real blow to the ego!

## PlusWord

From there, we move onto [PlusWord](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/plusword/) by [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/), a game that’s sort of a mix between a crossword and [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). You’re given a 5×5 set of squares and 10 clues, and, like your typical crossword, you have to fill in each of those squares with a letter to spell out 5 letter words: 5 horizontally and 5 vertically.

After doing that, you move below the 5×5 grid where there’s a row of 5 squares that aligns with the grid above. Of those 25 letters in the 5×5 grid, some will be highlighted either yellow or green.

Letters highlighted *green* indicate that that letter appears in the word in the row at the bottom in the same position, e.g. if a letter in the 2<sup>nd</sup> column of the grid is highlighted green, the same letter is the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of the word at the bottom.

Letters highlighted *yellow* indicate that that letter appears in the word in the row at the bottom *but not in the same position*, e.g. if a letter in the 2<sup>nd</sup> column of the grid is highlighted yellow, the same letter appears in the word at the bottom, but will *not* be the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter (i.e. it will be 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, or 5<sup>th</sup>).

This one can be a bit tricky, as it will sometimes have references to pop culture or media that we’re not familiar with. Fortunately, because the words in the grid intersect with each other, it’s still possible to solve those unknowns, but it just takes extra time. Our best time on *PlusWord* is 12 seconds, but we usually come closer to 1 minute.

## Cryptic Crossword

My favourite and the most challenging of the games we play is the [Daily Cryptic Crossword](https://lovattspuzzles.com/online-puzzles-competitions/daily-cryptic-crossword/) by [Lovatts Crosswords & Puzzles](https://lovattspuzzles.com/).

Cryptic crosswords are a bit more difficult to explain if you’ve never tried them yourself. Much like any standard crossword, you’ve got a big grid of squares and a bunch of clues, and the idea is to fill in the words that correspond to each of the clues. What makes cryptic crosswords more… cryptic is the way that the clues work.

In a standard crossword, for example, you might have the clue, <q>from the biblical garden, meaning <q>delight</q></q> and a 4-letter word that corresponds with it. In this case, the answer is (most likely to be) <q>EDEN</q>.

With cryptic crosswords, however, clues are usually far less obvious, but often fall into at least one of a handful of different categories of clues. For the most part, the construction of a clue has three/four parts:

1. Wording that indicates the type of clue
2. A word or phrase that you operate on, given the type of clue
3. A word or phrase that is the definition or synonym of the answer
4. The length of the answer, often in parentheses at the end of the clue (but not all cryptic crosswords provide this, sadly)

Here are some examples of the types of clues you’ll find.

### Anagrams

An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. With these types of clues, you’ll normally find part of the clue’s wording tells you to transform a word or phrase to form the [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) to be solved, e.g. <q>becomes</q>, <q>turns into</q>, or <q>wildly</q>. For example, given the following clue:

**The mutating corona virus seems like a flesh-eater (11)**

We know that we’re looking for an 11-letter word, and the word <q>mutating</q> is a pretty good indicator that this is an anagram-type clue. In this case, the synonym of the answer is <q>flesh-eater</q>, and if we rearrange <q>corona virus</q>, we get:

<p class="center"><strong>CARNIVOROUS</strong></p>

### Sound Clues

With these types of clues, like with anagrams, you’ll often find some wording in the clue that tells you’re looking for a word or phrase that sounds like part of the clue, e.g. <q>we hear</q>, <q>aloud</q>, etc. I find it best to slowly read these aloud to try to find the answer. For example, given the following clue:

**Pray out loud for victim (4)**

The words <q>out loud</q> jump out and tell us that this is a sound clue, so the definition/synonym of the answer is either <q>pray</q> or <q>victim</q>. In this case, the sound of the word <q>pray</q> could also make the word:

<p class="center"><strong>PREY</strong></p>

Which is a synonym of <q>victim</q>!

### Spoonerisms

Spoonerisms are definitely one of the more entertaining types of clues, and they’re also one of the easiest to spot. Look for the word <q>Spooner</q>!

I can hear you asking, <q>Okay, but what in the world is a Spooner?!</q>

This type of clue is similar to a sound clue, but instead of hearing a particular word amongst other words, you have to swap sounds between two parts of a phrase. For example, given the following clue:

**Dead end for a dull cossack, according to Spooner (8)**

The last part of the clue is telling us that this is a Spoonerism, so the other parts of the clue are likely to be <q>dead end</q> and <q>dull cossack</q>. I’ll spare you a lengthy exercise in swapping around sounds here, but if we take the phrase <q>dull cossack</q> and swap the consonants at the beginning of each word, we get <q>cull dossack</q>. Try saying that out loud, and you’ll find a rough synonym of <q>dead end</q>:

<p class="center"><strong>CUL-DE-SAC</strong></p>

<hr style="--rule-space: var(--size-medium);">

That’s a small taste of how cryptic crosswords work. Sort of like an opposite of chess, it’s difficult to learn, but a lot easier to master. After a week or two of doing daily cryptic crosswords, you get more and more familiar with the different types of clues (of which there are ~10), and it becomes easier to identify what you’re working with. Lots of fun!

We haven’t been on our best game lately, so have been getting times around 8 minutes, but our best time ever for the Lovatts daily cryptic crossword is a whopping 4 minutes and 34 seconds!
