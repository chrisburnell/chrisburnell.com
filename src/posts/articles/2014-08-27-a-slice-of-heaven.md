I’ve been making quite a few pens over on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) lately, mostly exploring what can be achieved with only CSS where in the past we would have to look to JavaScript or bloating our user’s pipes with image requests—which is a [whole other universe](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element "The Picture Element") nowadays.

All of the examples are interactive, so make sure you hover or click where necessary; although, they are best suited for a tablet or desktop, so if you’re viewing on mobile, they may not work as intended.

## Psychedelic Slice

Hover the slice to see how this one works.

<c-codepen slug="apogK"></c-codepen>

In this Pen, I’m taking advantage of `border-radius` and `overflow` on an element affecting its children—in this case pseudo elements—to create a one-third slice of a circle without images and a transparent background.

<div class="edit">
    updated_text: There is a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=157218" rel="external">Chrome bug</a> with <code>border-radius</code> and <code>overflow</code> not masking child elements property when modified with a <code>transform</code>. Hopefully this is fixed soon, but in the meantime, I’ve added a <code>border-radius</code> and an associated <code>transform</code> on the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> elements.

## Zoomy Anchor Thing

This pen was inspired by an neat effect I saw on [Square](https://squareup.com#verticals).

## Modal Container without JavaScript

This pen was inspired by Chris Coyier’s [blog post on _CodePen_](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/post/a-closeable-noscript-warning-modal "A Closeable Noscript Warning Modal") explaining how they handle users who have turned off JavaScript and won’t be able to use *CodePen* properly, as the website relies on JavaScript to display Pens.

<c-codepen slug="scyKF" height="350px"></c-codepen>

One of the often underused but **powerful** utilities available in HTML is the relationship between an `input` element and its `label` element—you can even use multiple `label`s to control your `input` field. This allows you a JavaScript-free toggle, which you can use to show/hide elements, toggle styles, and more.

## Slip-n-slide Modal

This was an effect I’ve seen used across the web before that I’d wanted to try building for myself but never got around to it. It’s a bit jittery, so if you can figure out how to make this one [jank-free](http://jankfree.org/ "Jank Free"), let me know in the [comments](#respond). It uses the same concept as the *Modal Container without JavaScript* to show and hide the modal content.

## Jazzy CSS Checkbox Revisited

This is a pen which I overhauled a bit since I first wrote about it in <a href="/article/persistent-shadows/">Persistent Shadows</a>:

<c-codepen slug="arouk" height="250px"></c-codepen>

And the revisited version:

<c-codepen slug="Cbiun" height="250px"></c-codepen>

Input fields have always been a point of pain for front end developers. Using this method we get around having to worry about styling them and rely on the sibling selectors (`+` and `~`, see more [on Can I use...](http://caniuse.com/#search=css-sel2 "Sibling Selectors")) to modify the styles applied to the `input`’s associated `label` element based on the `:checked` state of the `input`.

{% css %}@layer components { {%- include '../../../css/components/browser-support.css' -%} }{% endcss -%}
{% browserSupport 'css-sel2' %}

Big thanks goes to [Dan Simmons](https://twitter.com/dansimau "Dan Simmons on Twitter") for helping me improve this even further by adding keyboard support for the hidden `input` field.
