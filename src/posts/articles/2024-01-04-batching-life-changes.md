title: Batching Life Changes
description: I’ve never really done a “year in review” post before, but 2023 and, in particular, the last few months, have brought tides of change that I feel the need to share.

I kicked 2023 off with a pretty big change in my professional life as I transitioned roles at [Squiz](https://squiz.net). Before 2023, I had been a *Lead Developer*, working on projects for clients in the Services team and acting as line manager to a couple of developers.

In January, I was eager and excited to be invited to move into the Product team as a *Software Engineer*. Although it meant giving up my responsibilities as a manager, which was truly enjoyable and rewarding, I joined an enthusiastic and incredibly-knowledgable team of other Software Engineers in charge of building internal tools and software to accelerate the tasks of developers building client projects.

This was certainly a tall order, as the amount of research, thought, and work before our team was vast, but we had an excellent set of processes that meant we were always aligned and focussed on building a powerful and expansive framework of components to jump-start the work of the Services team. This also offered me the opportunity to cut my teeth on React, TypeScript, unit and end-to-end testing, JavaScript performance and optimisation, and really get involved in defining best practices for the team and wider teams of developers working with our framework and components.

My manager, [Jason Matthew](https://www.jasonmatthew.dev), was an exceptional and patient mentor as I rapidly expanded my front end horizons over the year in his team. What really meant a tremendous amount to me was his compassion, trust, and confidence to give me the space and time to unionise my knowledge of the front end and specific expertise (CSS, accessibility, design systems, etc.) with our business-critical work. He has so many admirable qualities as both a friend and a leader; anyone who finds themselves in the fortunate position of being around him will undoubtedly realise just how lucky they are and how talented he is.

I feel like this was where I really shined in the team. It gave me an immense sense of purpose and impact. I’ll forever be grateful for the year I spent under his leadership and amongst my teammates—I see it as one of the monumental highlights of my career in front end to date.

## Turning over a new leaf

People who know me well could probably tell you how quiet and private I tend to be about my personal life. But sometimes things happen that you just want to shout so loudly and proudly that the whole cosmos can hear:

<p class=" [ alpha  center ] " style="margin-block-start: 1rem">I got married!</p>

After nearly 13 of the best years of my life with my incomparable partner, Rachel, we tied the knot at the beautiful [Hackney Town Hall](https://www.hackneyvenues.com/hackney-town-hall)! It was *unequivocally* one of the best days of my life. Completely and utterly unforgettable. I’m looking forward to years to come of showing her my unending love, making her laugh every day (whether she wants to or not), and being by her side as we shape the most joyful and fulfilling lives together.

I do have to admit that I don’t feel *entirely* different now that it’s <span class="silly">{{ 'official in the eyes of the law' | spongebob }}</span>—after 13 years together, I’d like to think we’ve got this thing figured out—but our getting married has set the stage for the next chapter of our lives together.

## Singapore

After 12 challenging but accomplished years in London, we made the difficult decision to pack up our lives and move to Rachel’s home country of [Singapore](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/1.3156/103.9425)! I’ve visited many times over the years, so it’s not completely new territory for me, and I absolutely love it here. The heat (and rain!) will take some getting used to, though!

Even though it was painful to do so, I ended up tending my resignation at *Squiz* at the end of 2023, but it wasn’t so much a choice I actively made as a necessary step in our move. It was probably time to *spread my wings*, so to speak, and explore what kind of impact I can have elsewhere with the skills and knowledge I’ve accrued over 15 years as a developer.

Between getting married, ending my 8-year (cumulative) tenure at *Squiz*, and selling/giving away a lot of our things and packing up the rest into a shipping container, November and December were a whirlwind of stress, excitement, and gargantuan change.

After saying our goodbyes and tying up *way too many* loose ends, we were all set and left on a one-way trip to Singapore. It was and has been sad for us to leave our lives, friends, and beloved walking paths of Clapton behind, but we’re optimistic about our future here and looking forward to enjoying all that Singapore has to offer. I’m already up 2 kilograms… the food here is unparalleled!

We had an amazing Christmas and New Year’s Eve, but now it’s time to get down to more serious business: going through the process of securing my long-term visitor’s pass and finding myself a job here, where I’m really hoping I can lean even further into my passion for front end development, mentoring, writing, and educating in the form of a Developer Advocate role.

All in all, 2023 was a year full of hard work, stress, and unbelievable highlights that I surely won’t forget. Although I’m nervous and anxious about what the future holds, I’m charged and motivated to see what 2024 will bring!
