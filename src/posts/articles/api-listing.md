title: The &lt;api-listing&gt; web component
description: TODO

Idea:

Refactor `<lastfm-listening>` into a web component that can consume any API call that returns an array of data

Use David Darnesâ€™ mastodon-post https://github.com/daviddarnes/mastodon-post to create templates to map the data and output desired HTML from the API call

Figure out how it can be used both in Node and front end?
