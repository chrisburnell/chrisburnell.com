title: A Decade in the Making
description: 2019 marks ten years that I've been making a mess on the web. While making a mess has always been the norm for me, documenting it publicly, irreversibly, for eternity, might seem a little out of character. A decade later, what's changed? What have I learned? What will I be doing differently in another decade's time?

So I’ve officially been a Webmaster for a decade now.

This is a big achievement for me because it nicely sums up and boils down my sentiments towards the web. While others might be more inclined to celebrate the fruits of their labour, I’d like to celebrate the labour itself.

I feel extremely fortunate that the labour, for me, is one of perpetual love.

I still remember my feelings towards rolling one’s own website when I registered my first domain.

The control. The confidence that came with being in control. The unending horizon of creative possibilities that came with that confidence.

No longer was I another not-yet-eclipsed star in the Geocities galaxy. More mine than any Blogger profile, I was finally part of the <q>Blogosphere</q>, whatever that meant for 18-year-old me *(very little, it turns out)*.

Looking back on my content, *my, how I’ve aged… thankfully*.

But it’s that I have any content to speak of that I’m celebrating. <q>Just write and just publish.</q> <em>(I’m aware of the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just" title="Just, an article by Brad Frost">assumptions</a> I’m making when using the word <q>just</q> here. I think my point, though, is that the only thing stopping you from publishing is <em>you</em>.)</em> A decade later, when I look back to my earliest work, it’s almost like looking into the mind of a different person. I do remember being that person, but I feel like I’ve grown a great deal since my first foray into web development.

Over the years of writing, editing, and not publishing, I regret almost every piece of work I’ve not published. I naïvely wanted to write prose that was ephemeral and rung true no matter how far into the future a reader might be. Sure,

But this is an impossible task. There is an inescapable timeliness to words and prose.
