## January: Grunge

On the whole, I really enjoyed exploring grunge more this month! There were some classic, quintessential tracks in there that I was already pretty intimately aware of, but it was nostalgic and it always rules to listen to great music you haven’t heard before.

Although I *did* listen to a smattering of <span class="silly"><q>big music’s</q></span> *Grunge* playlists (e.g. [The Grunge Era on YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=RDCLAK5uy_kQDX7ciH8Pm8h48FWNLv5suF7U6abRhU4)) and sampled through some <q>top 50 albums of all time</q> lists (e.g. [50 Greatest Grunge Albums by Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-grunge-albums-798851/)), I think I let my own personal taste really take the reins this month. Because I ended up really enjoying so much of it, it was hard to stop listening to artists and albums once I put them on! Even though I don’t think it was necessarily a mistake, I’m going to try to cast a wider net going forward and absorb *more* music, rather than latch onto the first things that prick up my ears.

I want to guess that I listened to *at least* 100 hours of Grunge across January, and I captured [10 albums on my Music Reviews page](/music/) that really stood out to me. I don’t know whether it’s a testament to just how good these bands are at grunge, or just the pervasive nature of *popularity*, but most of them are the well-known heavy-hitters of the grunge world.

In no particular order, here are a few of my favourites from this month:

<div class=" [ grid ] [ shelf  shelf--square ] ">
{% for title in ['Jar of Flies', 'In Utero', 'Superunknown'] -%}{% set item = collections.categoryMusic | arrayKeyValueEquals('data.title', title, false) | first %}{{ shelfItem(item, { truncate: true }) | replace(r/\n+/g, "") | safe }}{%- endfor %}
</div>

I also received some much-appreciated recommendations from a handful of lovely folks: [James Elliker](https://mastodon.social/@ellikerjames) recommended a whole [personalised list of top 50 albums](https://mastodon.social/@ellikerjames/115859716847721196) which was incredibly fruitful; [Nathan Knowler](https://knowler.dev/) recommended [Superheaven’s album from last year](https://bsky.app/profile/knowler.dev/post/3mbtyovsbc22v) which helped me settle into the driver’s seat of a nomad in the grunge world; and [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com) recommended I check out [Babes in Toyland](https://adactio.com/notes/22346) (two very sick music videos). Thanks all!

I suspect I’m going to be juggling grunge through February as well, so don’t be surprised if a few albums slip onto my Music Reviews page over the next… well, probably over the course of this year!

I’m going to take a quick moment to pay myself on the back for taking on this idea or project or whatever you want to call it. It has been really fun and I encourage you to join! Reject the Gregorians and start your own exploration into new and semi-familiar genres whenever you want!

On with February!

## Vaporwave

To say that I’m new to this genre would be… a complete and utter lie! I got really into it probably around a decade ago, and I’ve been listening to it pretty steadily ever since.

With that being said, my exploration of the genre has been *pretty* limited. As with my month focusing on grunge, I’ve tended to be drawn to depth rather than breadth. I’m hoping by <span class="silly">cheating</span> with a rather familiar genre this early on will help me get into exploring more. Pausing along the way is fine—pun ~not~ intended—but covering as much ground as I can over the course of this short month is my goal!

I imagine I’ll be fleshing out my Music Review section with some old favourites that I never added for whatever reason, but I’m hoping to find myself immersed in that wonderful, euphoric feeling of discovering something new that electrifies you once again.

’Til March!
