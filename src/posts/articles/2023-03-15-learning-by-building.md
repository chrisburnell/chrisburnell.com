title: Learning by Building
description: One of the more powerful and fun features in CSS today is the clamp() function, and after being fascinated by the amazing tools out there to help us calculate values for the function, I had an urge to figure out how those calculators worked. So I set out to build my own—what better way to learn than by having to build it myself?

Back in 2020, I was first introduced to the concept of <q>[Fluid custom properties](/bookmark/fluid-custom-properties-utopia/)</q>. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this would be the catalyst that would send me down a rabbit-hole of CSS, ravenously consuming all the new web features and techniques being used on the bleeding-edge of front end for the next several years. Between CSS Variables (custom properties), Logical Properties, and novel new ways of architecting CSS, it has been one of the best times to be a front end developer.

My enthusiasm for CSS and yearning to build more only grew*if you can believe it*—after being lucky enough to attend [All Day Hey in 2022](/note/all-day-hey-2022/) where I saw [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/) deliver his prolific talk, <q>[Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M)</q>. I **strongly** suggest watching if you’re even remotely involved in front end development; the talk and accompanying website (Andy can talk the talk, but he can walk the walk too) are groundbreaking milestones. As Andy explains the simplicity of this new mindset towards building on the web, and how flexible, powerful, and truly simple the code is, it’s like witnessing the painting of the Sistene Chapel, each brush-stroke galvanising my love for the language and its explosion in the last many years.
