Thinking back on the time that my Mum gave me the first six [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com) books as a gift when I first left Canada to start my career in the UK in 2011. They meant so, so much to me. Not just for the enlightening words within, but also because they were this tangible thing that reminded me of the encouragement from my very academic family to take on the daunting task of “making it on my own” without a degree.

Those books inspired the hell out of me. I treated the words inside like gospel. I immersed myself in front end and the web and worked hard to become really good at my craft. Little did I know that, in time, not only would I get to meet some of these accomplished authors, but they would actually know who *I* was too. I had dreams of getting to finally meet them—heroes in my eyes—to totally fanboy out and get their autographs on the inside covers.

A few months later, I landed my first proper gig in the industry as a Front End Developer. I almost couldn’t believe it. I did it. It was really happening.

Boy, did I learn a lot in those first few months. It felt like that scene in The Matrix where Neo is learning a new martial art every minute. I was also extremely lucky to work with some truly talented, patient, and kind designers and developers, many of whom I still consider great friends today.

A short time passed, and my young and naïve self, wanting to share all the incredible stuff I had learned, brought the books into work.

That same afternoon, I went to make a coffee in the kitchen, and when I came back, the books were gone from my desk. No one admitted to taking them, and I never saw them again. It broke my heart and made my blood boil.

Still does.

Here I am now, 12 years later, having recently moved from London to Singapore, and finding myself in a similar situation as before: facing the stupidly-scary task of trying to find success off the back of my own efforts. Of course, I know a lot more now than I did back then—or so I’d like to think!—but new environments have always been a true test of my resilience.

Ever since those first few months in my first front end role, I’ve wanted to work in Developer Relations. It was never something that seemed to fit into where I was in my career or who I was as a person, despite my best efforts in every job and role I’ve had since then to *make* it a part of my job, however small that part may have been. Whether it was organising short, weekly meetings to talk about interesting new technology, share fun and interesting things I’d found, or even just being a knowledgable voice pushing for better standards, accessibility practices, etc. I was always reaching for it.

This time, though, I think I finally have the gumption and drive to make it happen. To not just reach for it but to leap halfway around the world and wrestle it into my hands. In fact, I’m determined and steadfast that I *will* find success, once again, no matter the challenges and doubt that I’ll face along the way.

I guess I owe it to myself to order new copies of the books that I lost and fulfil that fanboy dream of mine from 12 years ago. Hopefully once I’ve found my way here in Singapore and built up some steam, I can make my way back for a short visit (ideally around [State of the Browser](https://stateofthebrowser.com)) and see it through. It’ll be a reminder of the encouragement from *myself* to persevere, believe in my success, and “make it on my own” all over again.
