title: Halfway to CSS Naked Day 2024
description: What better time is there to prepare for next yearâ€™s CSS Naked Day than the halfway point? Certainly better than the day before, take it from me!

I was really happy to [participate in CSS Naked Day](/article/why-css-naked-day/) earlier this year, and today marks the halfway point to CSS Naked Day 2024. Just six more months until itâ€™s time to don the [<em>Emperorâ€™s New Clothes</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes) and <q>show off your <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for what it really is.</q> <small>([CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/))</small>

If you use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) or use JavaScript to build your website, check out my *article*, [CSS Naked Day JavaScript Function](/article/css-naked-day-javascript-function/), for a swift guide to how I prepared for next yearâ€™s event, which actually [spans for *50 hours*. ðŸ¤”](/article/why-css-naked-day/#how-long-is-a-day)

In the article, I explain how Iâ€™ve set up a DateTime check to figure out <q>Is it CSS Naked Day?</q>. The result controls whether or not to link to CSS in my templatesâ€™ HTML, and the check runs every time my website builds.

That includes CI/CD builds, which effectively means I can <q>set it and forget it</q>, which I *love* being able to do.

Hope to see you participating on the {{ 9 | ordinal | safe }} of April as well!
