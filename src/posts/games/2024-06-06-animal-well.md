Barring any unforeseen playthroughs, this is taking the #1 spot as my Game of the Year for 2024. It’s so unbelievably polished and does a damn-near perfect job of satiating two of my favourite gameplay features: collecting and exploration. The controls are super tight and it has some of the best movement in a game that I’ve played for a long time—right up there with [Breath of the Wild](/game/breath-of-the-wild/) and [Tears of the Kingdom](/game/tears-of-the-kingdom/) but with far simpler and approachable controls.

While it can be <s>a little</s> very difficult at times, especially when it comes to puzzle-solving, remembering the layout of the world you’re in, and one’s deftness with the controls, it’s absolutely worth checking out.
