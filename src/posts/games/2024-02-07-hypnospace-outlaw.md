As someone who grew up on the internet and loved exploring the web from as early as ~1998, *Hypnospace Outlaw* was an absolute trip, and I enjoyed the game deeply. Since the beginning of 2024 or so, I’ve been diving down rabbit holes chasing the nostalgia of the early web, and this game scratches that itch so damn well.

I was a little worried as I played through the game that it would be like reliving the disappearance of the old web, with so much lost to time and living on only in our collective consciousness. However, despite the game’s twists and turns, I’m left feeling moreso happy and sentimental to be able to bask in the warm embrace of a game that captures that time so faithfully and beautifully.
