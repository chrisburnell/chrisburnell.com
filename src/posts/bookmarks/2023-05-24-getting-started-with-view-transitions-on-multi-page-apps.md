title: "Getting started with View Transitions on multi-page apps"
description: "This post really helped me understand just how surprisingly easy it is to start using View Transitions—as quick as a single meta tag in the head to enable fade/opacity transitions—and a slew of other great tips, tricks, and things to watch out for as we prepare for this great new browser feature to become stable!

Gotta love a good Animorphs reference, too."
