title: Polyfill Service
description: <q>The polyfill service selectively bundles browser polyfills based on the User-Agent header supplied in a request, with the intention of allowing JavaScript and CSS developers to use modern standards in legacy user agents that do not natively support the standard. Think of it like a pair of glasses for your aging browser.</q>
