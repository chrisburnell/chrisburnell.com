I had the pleasure of seeing [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/) of [Set Studio](https://set.studio/) deliver a talk at [All Day Hey!](/note/all-day-hey-2022/) all about how this website was build. The subject matter, mainly focussed around authoring clean, concise, and powerful CSS, made for one of the most exciting talks I’ve ever seen—still buzzing from all the densely-packed wisdom and the drive to try it all out myself (watch this space)!

You can find the [slides of the talk on Notist](https://noti.st/hankchizljaw/sFPK4R/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager) and even [play with the website on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/build-excellent-websites).
