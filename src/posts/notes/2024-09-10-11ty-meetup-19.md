<q>This month, we're coming live from APAC and Europe for two talks. Helen Chong will walk us through her journey migrating to 11ty version 3.0 and Estela Franco will show us how she built an 11ty blog using the Storyblok headless CMS.</q>

I also upgraded to version 3.0 this year and actually enjoyed the process, so Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing how others found it, and also about how to integrate a headless CMS with Eleventy!
