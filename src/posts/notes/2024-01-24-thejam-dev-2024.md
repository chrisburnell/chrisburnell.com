What an incredible line-up of speakers! And it’s free too! Can’t wait for this one.

Not the easiest time to commit to from my timezone, but I’ll be staying up as late as I can to watch some great talks on the Jamstack to learn more about the state of JavaScript frameworks, deployment, serverless, headless, and tonnes more. What’s also great is that all the talks will be recorded, so if I have to tap out early, I won’t miss anything!

Looking forward to the tsunami of inspiration that will surely come!
