Just a short update today, as I’ve been pretty busy in the last few days with my nose to the grindstone, continuing my job search.

<aside style="background-color: color-mix(in oklab, currentColor, transparent 95%); padding: var(--size-medium);">
    <p>I’m looking for roles in the Front End and/or Developer Relations space. If you think you might be able to help or have any leads, I’d love if you’d be so kind as to <a href="/about/#contact">get in touch with me</a>!</p>
</aside>

Ever since joining the [32-Bit Café community](https://32bit.cafe) earlier this year, I’ve come to realise that one of my great joys comes from jumping into technical challenges and having the opportunity to guide and help others understand new things.

For this reason, I’ve created a new page on my website:

<nav class=" [ grid ] [ navigator ] ">
    <a href="/help/" class=" [ button  ] ">Help!</a>
</nav>

It’s an open call for folks to book some of my time, however valuable that may be, for us to have some back-and-forth (on a voice call, over instant messages, etc.) where I can try to be of some assistance in overcoming whatever challenges might be thrown my way.

If this sounds like something you might like to do, please don’t hesitate to get in touch; there’s no rabbit-hole too deep for me to dive into!
