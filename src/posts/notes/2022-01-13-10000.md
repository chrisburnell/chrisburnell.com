title: "10000"

It’s been nearly **nine years** since I last updated my website's logo, the ethereal Raven, but **sixteen years** since I began my journey into web development. To commemorate reaching a <abbr title="10000 in binary">5-bit milestone</abbr>, this year seemed like a good one to take a crack at a serious refresh in the hopes of bringing some punch and life to its mark on my work.

I *really* love it, and I hope you do too. *If not, check out my [RSS feed](/feed.xml)!* 😂
