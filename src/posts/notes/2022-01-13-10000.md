Itâ€™s been nearly **nine years** since I last updated my website's logo, the ethereal Raven, but **sixteen years** since I began my journey into web development. To commemorate reaching a <span title="16 in base 10 = 10000 in binary">5-bit milestone</span>, this year seemed like a good one to take a crack at a serious refresh in the hopes of bringing some punch and life to its mark on my work.
