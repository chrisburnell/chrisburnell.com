Over the last couple of months I’ve made some small improvements and additions to 🐋 [Bowhead](https://chrisburnell.com/bowhead/), which is now at [version 0.2.1](https://github.com/chrisburnell/bowhead/releases/tag/0.2.1). Since last posting about it, I’ve cleaned up the documentation, added some minor bits and pieces, and used it across a number of projects. The most rewarding has been seeing it being used both “in the wild” and with other developers on professional work.
