    alt: "A Korok, resembling a small, living tree with arms, legs, and a smiling face from the video game Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, stands (superimposed) atop an intricate structure made of small stones, polished into cubes and organised in a tight and symmetrical way. In reference to the video game, where the player can find and replace missing pieces of these structures, and upon doing so, a Korok will appear to congratulate the player, exclaiming, “Yahah! You found me!”, which is displayed in a dialogue box below the Korok."
