I was [tagged](https://linh.social/@qlp/114586765878511923) several days ago on Mastodon, as someone was looking for a [<q>90s-style 88x31 footer GIF</q>](https://linuxmom.net/@vkc/114586734164356317) for pages built with Eleventy, and it has been just over a year now since I first created mine:

<figure>
	<img src="/images/built-with-eleventy.gif" alt="Built with Eleventy badge" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="border-radius: 0;">
    <figcaption><em>Shown at 4× original size so that the detail is a bit easier to see.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

I had a lot of fun creating a handful of [88x31 badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge), and the post on Mastodon reinvigorated my desire to play with pixels. So this evening, I once again fired up [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and gave animating the badge a shot!

<figure>
	<img src="/images/animated/built-with-eleventy.gif" alt="Built with Eleventy animated badge" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="border-radius: 0;">
</figure>

It may not be the most flashy 88x31 badge you’ve ever seen, but I think it’s pretty fun in its simplicity, and it’s only 3.5 <abbr title="kilobytes">kB</abbr>.

You’ve got my **full permission**<sup>*</sup> to take it and use it on your own “Built with Eleventy” websites!

<sup>*</sup> If you’re using it as-is, attribution would be cool, but it’s totally not a necessity. If you want to share it on, adapt it in any way, etc., I’d just ask that you respect the [Creative Commons license](/license/) that it falls under.

**Update!** I also built some longer versions that include call-outs to the [11ty.dev](https://11ty.dev) website.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/animated/built-with-eleventy-long.gif" alt="Built with Eleventy longer animated badge" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="border-radius: 0;">
    <figcaption><em>This one’s a bit chunkier, clocking in at 9.3 kB.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/animated/built-with-eleventy-long-alternate.gif" alt="Built with Eleventy alternate longer animated badge" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="border-radius: 0;">
    <figcaption><em>And this one’s a bit bigger than the previous at 9.7 kB.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
