Only one month until State of the Browser, and I will once again be organising, but this year I’ll be there *in-person*! 🥳

Sadly, I’ve had to do what I can *rather remotely* since 2023, so I’m really looking forward to some amazing talks, meeting old pals, and making new ones too.

Less than 15 in-person tickets left, so I hope to see you there! (I’ll just take credit for any tickets claimed in the next hour or so 😘)
