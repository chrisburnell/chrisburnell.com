    alt: Photo of a greyed, dead tree, toppled over, lying partially-exposed in a small pond/bog, which is dotted with waterlillies and their pad-like leaves. Surrounding the pond is the characteristic dense carpet of forest undergrowth that can be found across Atlantic Canada, interspersed chiefly with small coniferous trees, which can also be seen in greater size and number in the background, beyond a field of undergrowth.
