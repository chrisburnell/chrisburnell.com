State of the Browser’s **eleventh** edition is coming up on in just over a month on <time datetime="{{ site.sotb_date | rfc3339Date }}">{{ site.sotb_date | friendlyDate }}</time>, and, despite the anxiety that comes with the lead-up, it’s sure to deliver the same drive, motivation, and amazing folks I’ve come to expect every year!
