Fun stuff I’m proud of achieving on my website recently:

- finished building and released [eleventy-cache-webmentions](/eleventy-cache-webmentions/) as a working and publicly-avaliable Eleventy plugin, which automates retrieving and sorting of Webmentions as well as being as kind as possible to the [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io) API
- automatic fetch and generation of image formats for avatars within Webmentions
- automatic generation of image formats for post banners, covers, photos, and inline images
- relegated [my personal Speedlify instance](https://speedlify.chrisburnell.com) to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) which builds quickly and without my manual intervention—GitHub and my server and wholly-unable to process things quickly enough and fail before completing

Still to work on:

- automatic fetch and generation of music review covers from Spotify/Odesli
