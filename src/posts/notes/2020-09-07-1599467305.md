ðŸšš [Bowhead](https://chrisburnell.com/bowhead/) is now at [version 0.1.8](https://github.com/chrisburnell/bowhead/releases/tag/0.1.8), which adds a few things and fixes others, namely cleaning up what files are packaged for *npm* so as to send as little as necessary.

If you're looking for a barebones SCSS solution for managing design tokens or even for a tool that will generate CSS Variables for you, Iâ€™d be honoured if you gave it a try:

```bash
npm install @chrisburnell/bowhead
```
