Just over a week ago, I published [<q>What are you interested in?</q>](/note/slash-interests/), and I’ve been really pleased with the responses from around the web!

Because people seem to be quite interested in the idea—with some folks having already published fully-fledged `/interests` pages of their own—I decided to create a directory for these pages to help with discoverability.

I put a decent chunk of work into trying to make the wording as clear as possible and submitting your own website straightforward too. I’d love to hear your feedback to improve either of these things.

<nav class=" [ grid ] [ navigator ] ">
    <a href="https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/" class=" [ button ] " rel="external noopener">The /interests Directory</a>
