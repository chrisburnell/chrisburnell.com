I’ve been loving developing with Eleventy recently, so I’m *really* looking forward to another 11ty Meetup. This one’s all about building a meetup community using global data files and using Eleventy to build a rich, personal website that showcases all sorts of things other that just a blog—very IndieWeb.

Looking forward to it, as usual!
