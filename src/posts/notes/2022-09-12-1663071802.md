Happy to announce that Iâ€™ve released version `1.0.0` of Eleventy Cache Webmentions! Although it introduces some breaking changes for earlier versions, `1.0.0` makes it a lot easier to attach Webmentions to your pages as data using `eleventyComputed`. Check out my recent post, [Webmention Setup for Eleventy](https://chrisburnell.com/article/webmention-eleventy-setup/), to get started!
