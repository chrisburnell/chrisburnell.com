<q>In this episode, Bob will walk us through how he built his books page, and Sia will show us how she built a data and chart-heavy website.</q>

I’ve been thinking for a while now that I should spruce up my big listing pages, like /books and /beer, so I’m very keen to hear how Bob has constructed *his* books page. Looking forward to hearing from Sia once again; I’m particularly interested in seeing all the SVG-related charts and graphs that she’s generating with 11ty!
