Yesterday, I finished watching [Berserk](https://trakt.tv/shows/berserk), an anime adaptation of the Japanese manga of the same name, for the second time.

As far as animes go, I have to put it right up there with some of my other favourites like [Death Note](https://trakt.tv/shows/death-note), [Cowboy Bebop](https://trakt.tv/shows/cowboy-bebop), and [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://trakt.tv/shows/fullmetal-alchemist).

It tackles some rather profound themes and explores some of the darker sides of human nature and existence. One of these overarching themes is that of fate vs. free will, and the show does an incredible job of juxtaposing its characters’ battles to discover a sense of self and identity against being bound by the threads of destiny and predestination.

It also puts a spotlight on ideas to do with the human condition, friendship and betrayal, lust for power and corruption, and the inevitability of death, to name a few. Heavy stuff.

It’s gritty, bloody, and the ending is pretty disturbing (albeit a bit rushed, perhaps), leaving me with similarly mixed feelings of <q>What in the hell did I just witness?</q> and <q>Wow, that was *good*.</q> that I got after finishing other disturbing media like [Old Boy](https://trakt.tv/movies/oldboy-2003) or [Se7en](https://trakt.tv/movies/se7en-1995).

I might have to dip my toes into the world of manga and give this one a go!

Next up on my list are [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://trakt.tv/shows/neon-genesis-evangelion) and [Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion](https://trakt.tv/shows/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion), but what do you think? Got any recommendations for me?
