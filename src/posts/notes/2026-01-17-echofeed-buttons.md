[EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) is an incredible web service by my pal, [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me), that periodically checks your RSS feeds and can echo them out to various social media websites, and can even send Webmentions on your behalf!

I proudly use *EchoFeed* on my website. I think the Pro subscription ($25 a year) is **super** worth the cost, and in a time where it feels like we’re constantly drowning in low-effort, <q>let us monetise you</q> **slop**, it is abundantly evident that *EchoFeed* has been built with attention and care by someone who cares deeply for the web and its denizens, and that’s worth supporting in my book.

If the insane quality of Robb’s work doesn’t do enough to prove to you just how much faith the web community can put in his capable hands… heck, just try talkin’ to the guy. Leave some kindness for the rest of us, dude.

All this is to say that I did a little riffing on the illustrious [Andy Carolan’s](https://www.andycarolan.com) work in creating *EchoFeed’s* <q>Powered by EchoFeed</q> SVG buttons and remade them in the style of my other pixel-art 88x31 buttons (shown at 4× size so you can see more detail):

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 2em; margin-inline: auto; margin-block: var(--rule-space, var(--size-gigantic));">
	<img src="/images/powered-by-echofeed-orange.gif" alt="Powered by EchoFeed badge (orange)" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="margin-inline: 0;">
	<img src="/images/powered-by-echofeed-white.gif" alt="Powered by EchoFeed badge (white)" width="352" height="124" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" [ pixelated ] " style="margin-inline: 0;">
</div>

I’ve since relinquished any and all ownership I have over the buttons I created, and you can grab ’em on [the Buttons page](https://help.echofeed.app/buttons/) from the [EchoFeed Help Pages](https://help.echofeed.app).
