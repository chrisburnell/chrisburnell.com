<script type="module" src="/js/components/event-countdown.js"></script>

The first iteration of this event and a fun and interesting exercise to make sure Iâ€™m applying JavaScript as a progressive enhancement appropriately!

<figure class=" [ box ] [ gamma ] [ requires-js ] ">
	<event-countdown name="JS Naked Day" start="2024-04-23T10:00:00+0000" end="2024-04-25T12:00:00+0000"></event-countdown>
</figure>
