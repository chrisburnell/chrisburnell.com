I would love to try switching my site from <a href="https://twitter.com/jekyllrb">@jekyllrb</a> onto <a href="https://twitter.com/eleven_ty">@eleven_ty</a>, but it looks like such a huge undertaking, as I have _heavily_ customised the way I use Jekyll. Anyone got any pointers or quick changes I can make that will speed up/simplify the process? My current set-up looks like this: <a href="https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.com" rel="external">https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.com</a>
