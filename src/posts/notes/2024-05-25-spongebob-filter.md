In todayâ€™s quick post, Iâ€™m going to show how to use a couple of npm packagesâ€”[natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) and [random-case](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-case)â€”to build a rudimentary sentiment analyser that transforms the case of programmatically-determined *unsavoury* text to read like a <q>moCkING SPOnGEBOB MEme</q>.

I built this filter using ESM JavaScript:

```javascript
import Natural from "natural"
import randomCase from "random-case"

const sentimentAnalyzer = new Natural.SentimentAnalyzer("English", Natural.PorterStemmer, "afinn")

export const sentimentCheck = (string, threshold = -0.3) => {
	const words = string.match(/\b(\w+)\b/g)
	if (sentimentAnalyzer.getSentiment(words) <= threshold) {
		return randomCase(string)
	}
	return string
}
```

The `sentimentCheck` function splits the passed-in string into an array of just the words inside, and this array is analyzed for its sentiment and given a score from `-5` (extremely negative) to `5` (extremely positive). If the computed sentiment is less than a given threshold (`-0.3` in this case), then the string will be transformed into a random assortment of lowercase and uppercase characters!

This function can be used as an Eleventy Filter by pulling it into your Eleventy config file. By keeping the code in a file *outside* of the config file, it can be applied to strings in other JavaScript files *and* as a Nunjucks/Liquid Filter by importing it from the file that it lives in.

```javascript
import filters from "filters.js"

export default async function(eleventyConfig) {
	eleventyConfig.addFilter("sentimentCheck", filters.sentimentCheck)
}
```

This might be a good Filter to run against comments or Webmentions to spite anyone who writes nasty or snarky things on your website. For example, letâ€™s say weâ€™re using Nunjucks to loop through and print out replies to a post:

{% raw %}
```twig
{% for reply in replies %}
	<h4>{{ reply.name }}</h4>
	<p>{{ reply.content | sentimentCheck }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

The sentiment analyzer isnâ€™t as complex or powerful as one would hope, as it seems to work by building a tally of negative and positive words in a given string versus its length to get a computed sentiment value. For example, the phrase, <q>This is terribly smart</q> receives a score of `-0.5` because it contains the word <q>terribly</q>, even though it also contains the word <q>smart</q>. I guess the pre-defined vocabulary of positive and negative words scores <q>terribly</q> as more negative than <q>smart</q> is possible.

On the other hand, we might start finding ourselves in LLM territory if we wanted to implement something more complex than that. Iâ€™d rather avoid that, so it may be a good idea to tune the `threshold` value so that only extremely negative strings are transformed.

Feel free to dig into the [source code](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) if you want to experiment with your own vocabularies.

Either way, this might be a dumb idea, but it is pretty funny. ðŸ˜†
