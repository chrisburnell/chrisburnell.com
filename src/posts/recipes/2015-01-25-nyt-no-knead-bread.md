0. In a large bowl combine flour, salt, yeast, and water. Stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest *at least 12 hours, preferably about 18*, at warm room temperature, about *21°C/70°F*.
0. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about *15 minutes*.
0. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal as desired. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about *2 hours*. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
0. <a id="preheat-step" href="#preheat">At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 230°C/450°F.</a> Put a heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is okay. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake *30 minutes*, then remove lid and bake *another 15 to 30 minutes*, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
