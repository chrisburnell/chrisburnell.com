1. In a large bowl, combine <a href="#ingredient-flour">flour</a>, <a href="#ingredient-salt">salt</a>, <a href="#ingredient-yeast">yeast</a>, and <a href="#ingredient-water">water</a>. Stir until blended. The dough will be shaggy and sticky when blended sufficiently.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for *at least* 12 hours—preferably ~18 hours—at warm, room temperature (about 21°C/70°F). Dough will be ready for the next step when its surface is dotted with bubbles.
3. Lightly flour a work surface and place the dough on it. Sprinkle the dough with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice then cover it loosely with plastic wrap and let it rest for about *15 minutes*.
4. Using just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball.
5. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with <a href="#ingredient-flour">flour</a>, <a href="#ingredient-bran-or-cornmeal">bran, or cornmeal</a>. Put the dough *seam side down* on the towel and dust the dough with more <a href="#ingredient-flour">flour</a>, <a href="#ingredient-bran-or-cornmeal">bran, or cornmeal</a> as desired. Cover with another towel and let the dough rise for about *2 hours*. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
6. <span id="preheat-step">At least a half-hour before the dough is ready, preheat the oven up to 230°C/450°F.</span> Put a heavy covered pot in as it heats. When the dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Slide your hand under the towel and turn the dough over into the pot, seam side up. It may look like a mess, but that’s okay. Shake the pan once or twice if the dough isn’t evenly distributed; it will mostly straighten out as it bakes.
7. Cover the pot with a lid and bake for *30 minutes*. After this time, remove the lid and bake for *another 15 to 30 minutes*, until the loaf is beautifully browned.
8. Let the loaf cool on a rack.
