1.
    In the large mixing bowl, combine the ingredients with hands until reaching an even consistency:
    - 1 cup unsalted butter
    - 1¾ cups flour
    - 3 <abbr title="tablespoon">Tbsp</abbr> white sugar
    - ½ <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> salt
    - ¾ cup finely-ground almonds

2.
    Form the dough into crescent shapes, each ~2cm thick and ~8cm long.

3.
    <span id="roll-in-sugar">Roll them in sugar to coat the outside, taking care not to mangle them too much.</span>

4.
    Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, spacing the cookies out so they do not touch. *The cookies will not rise very much during baking so you can leave ~2–3cm between them.*

5.
    <span id="preheat-step">Bake at 160°C/325°F for 20 minutes.</span>

6.
    Place on a cooling rack once done. Once cooled, store in an airtight container or as long as they’ll last before being eaten!
