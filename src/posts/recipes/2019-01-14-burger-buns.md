1. <span id="preheat-step">Preheat oven to 220째C/425째F.</span>
2. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add oil and sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the egg, salt and enough flour to form a soft dough.
3. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide into 12 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place 3 in. apart on greased baking sheets.
4. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Bake for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
