*You can prepare the dough in a bread machine if yours has a dough setting, but mixing it by hand or in a stand mixer works too!*

1.
    Place the dough ingredients into the bread machine pan / a bowl in the following order:
    - 1 egg + enough water to equal 1 cup
    - 3 <abbr title="tablespoon">tbsp</abbr> butter/margarine
    - 1 <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> salt
    - 3¼ cups bread flour
    - 2 <abbr title="tablespoon">tbsp</abbr> non/low-fat evaporated milk
    - 3 <abbr title="tablespoon">tbsp</abbr> sugar
    - 2 <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> active dry yeast

2.
    If you’re *using a bread machine*, start the bread machine on the *dough setting* and let it go until the cycle is completed.

    If you’re *working the dough together by hand*, mix until it forms a consistent and smooth ball. Starting with a wooden spoon and finishing with your hands works well in my experience.

3.
    Tip the dough onto lightly-floured work surface, punch it down, and divide it into 18 equal pieces.

4.
    Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Place balls, 2 inches apart, into a greased baking tin (you can use butter / margarine to grease).

    The more grease you use, the crispier the edges will be! But you don’t want the dough to be swimming in grease either.

    Experiment with how much you like and tweak to your liking the next time you (inevitably) make these bread rolls.

5.
    Cover and let the dough balls proof in a warm, draft-free place for 30–60 minutes or until double in size.

    After some time (you’ll have to do some guessing), <span id="preheat-step">begin heating the oven to 190°C/375°F.</span>

6.
    When the dough balls have doubled in size, beat together egg wash ingredients (1 egg + 1 <abbr title="tablespoon">tbsp</abbr> water) and brush over the tops.

7.
    Bake at 190°C/375°F for 14–17 minutes or until the tops of the bread rolls are golden.
