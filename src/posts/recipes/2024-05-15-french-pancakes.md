1.
    In the large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients:
    - ¾ cup flour
    - ½ <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> salt
    - 1 <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> baking powder
    - 2 <abbr title="tablespoon">Tbsp</abbr> sugar

2.
    In the medium mixing bowl, beat together the wet ingredients:
    - 2 eggs
    - ⅔ cup milk
    - ⅓ cup water
    - ½ <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> vanilla extract

3.
    Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Combine them with a few swift strokes just until it comes together. Ignore the lumps; they will take care of themselves. Over-mixing will produce tough, flat pancakes!

4.
    Heat a skillet on medium heat and grease with a few drops of cooking oil.

5.
    Add a small quantity of batter and tip the skillet to let it spread a bit.

6.
    When it is brown underneath and bubbles are forming on the surface, flip the pancake to brown the other side.

7.
    Serve hot and fresh out of the pan, and don’t forget *plenty* of maple syrup!

*Use a few drops of oil to grease the skillet at least once every two pancakes. Once you’ve got a good idea of the ideal heat and cooking time, don’t be afraid to cook more than one at a time!*
